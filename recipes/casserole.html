        <p>"This casserole was easy to make and delicious," says reviewer FLCOOK. "I did add a variety of spices as suggested in earlier reviews, including Worcestershire sauce, a dash of hot sauce, garlic and nutmeg, and a little vinegar to draw out the tomatoes."

            "This recipe is excellent!" raves sunnybrook. "I added a can of drained tomatoes, garlic, and Italian seasoning. I would also recommend cutting this one in half. It makes a lot of food."
